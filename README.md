# Motion-Intrusion-Detection

The purpose of the project is to detect intrusion or motion by using background subtraction algorithm. Additionally, selective "alpha-blend" technique applied for background update in order to account for unstable lightning condition changes. The changes are recorded to a text file and objects are classified as person or object. Objects are further classified as true or false objects. More information can be found in the report.
